# Trinitarian Bible Society: Public Product Data
This repository contains product data and images for Trinitarian Bible Society (TBS) products.

If you notice any discrepancies in either the product data or images, or have queries about the data, please contact sales@tbsbibles.org.

## Images

When viewing the /images directory in a browser, GitHub will only show you a subset of images. To view them all, clone or download the repository.

Image filenames are based on the product code for the product the image depicts, with a letter appended - e.g. 31/ABK becomes 31_ABK-a.jpg, 31_ABK-b.jpg, etc. See the TBS Branding Guidelines for more details on standard images and naming conventions.

Some products also have some more contextual images; these contain the 'art' suffix - e.g. 31_ABK-art-a.jpg

This repository acts as the master source for all TBS product images.

## Product Data

Product data is updated automatically via a GitHub workflow in the YM-Product-Uploader repository (private).
